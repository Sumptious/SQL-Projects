This project was done on DataCamp Workspace using PostgreSQL. The objective is to analyse the financial performance of Unicorn companies
The insights generated will guide the investors on which industry to invest their money.
I Utilized SQL to analyze information about unicorn companies worth over $1 billion.
I worked with missing data as well as numeric, string and timestamp data types to Extract the year period required for the analysis.
I Implemented techniques such as aggregation, JOINS, Common Table Expressions to produce industries with high growth rate companies.
